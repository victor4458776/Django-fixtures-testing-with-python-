#DESCRIPTION
# auth.Group: This describes which model to dump. The format is <app_label>.<model_name>.

# --pk 1: This describes which object to dump. The value is a comma-delimited list of primary keys, such as 1,2,3.

# --indent 4: This is an optional formatting argument that tells Django how many spaces to add before each indention level in the generated file. Using indentions makes the fixture file more readable.

# > group.json: This describes where to write the output of the command. In this case, the output will be written to a file called group.json.
# GROUP-JSON

    }
}
# The fixture file contains a list of objects. In this case, you have only one object in the list. 
# Each object includes a header with the name of the model and the primary key, as well as a dictionary with the value 
#  for each field in the model. You can see that the fixture contains the name of the group appusers.
